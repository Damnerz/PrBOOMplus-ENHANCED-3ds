## -Definitions

#### The Github language

 What is a license on Github ?

So a license is a very important a text file for an open-source project like PrBoom-Plus-Enhanced. This document set the legal terms and conditions for using, distributing, and modifying the code of a software. They allow others to contribute and improve the sofware, build a community around the project and also protect the rights of the software users.

Here is the website of "free software foundation" for more informations.

- https://www.fsf.org/ 

Small definition of GNU-GPL :

GNU is an extensive collection of free software, which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other operating systems. The use of the completed GNU tools led to the family of operating systems popularly known as Linux. Most of GNU are licensed under the GNU Project's own General Public License (GPL).

#### The Doom language

What is a source port ?

For simple a source port is a software based on the source code of a game engine (linuxdoom 1.10) like the Doom Engine also called Id Tech 1 it's basically Doom 1, Doom 2 and many others licensed games like Hexen, Heretic, Blood, Duke Nukem 3D etc.

A source port allows the game to be played on operating systems and computing platforms with which the game wasn't originally compatible. (Thats why Doom run onerything)

#### The Homebrew language

What is a homebrew ?

In the easyest way to say, a homebrew is a game/software made by the hobbyists for proprietary video game consoles which are not intended to be user-programable. (hack your console and program an app with sdk, toolchain)
